# The Hakuran typeface

The Hakuran typeface is an open source typeface designed from scratch.

The goal is to provide a free, open font for use in open source projects
as well as on the web.
And eventually reaching full coverage of the entire unicode range.

The typeface is designed with *readability* and *education* in mind.
This means that glyphs are designed to look like they do when they are written
in hand, as humans perceive and replicate them.
